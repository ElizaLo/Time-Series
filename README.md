- [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/#) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, Monash University, Australia
  > This textbook is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods and to present enough information about each method for readers to be able to use them sensibly. We don’t attempt to give a thorough discussion of the theoretical details behind each method, although the references at the end of each chapter will fill in many of those details.
