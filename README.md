## Tools

### Frameworks

| Title | Description |
| :---:         |          :--- |
|[Kats](https://facebookresearch.github.io/Kats/) by Facebook|Kats is a toolkit to analyze time series data, a lightweight, easy-to-use, and generalizable framework to perform time series analysis. Time series analysis is an essential component of Data Science and Engineering work at industry, from understanding the key statistics and characteristics, detecting regressions and anomalies, to forecasting future trends. Kats aims to provide the one-stop shop for time series analysis, including detection, forecasting, feature extraction/embedding, multivariate analysis, etc. Kats is released by Facebook's Infrastructure Data Science team. It is available for download on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/kats/).|
|[Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) by Facebook|<ul><p>Prophet is a forecasting procedure implemented in R and Python. It is **Generalized additive model (GAM)** with three main components:  non-linear trends are fit with seasonality and holidays. </p><p> It is fast and provides completely automated forecasts that can be tuned by hand by data scientists and analysts. </p><p> g<sub>t</sub> is the piecewise linear or logistic growth curve to model the non-periodic changes in the time series, s<sub>t</sub> is the seasonality term, h<sub>t</sub> is the holiday effect with irregular schedules, and Œµt is the error term. </p><p> On a high level, Prophet is framing the forecasting problem as a curve-fitting exercise rather than looking explicitly at the time based dependence of each observation within a time series. </p><p> As a computational tool/software, moreover, Prophet allows users to manually supply change points in fitting the trend term and set the boundaries for saturation growth, which gives great flexibility in business applications. </p><p> Prophet is open source software released by Facebook‚Äôs Core Data Science team. It is available for download on CRAN and PyPI.</p></ul>|
|[Orbit](https://eng.uber.com/orbit/) by Uber|Orbit (**O**bject-**OR**iented **B**ayes**I**an **T**ime Series) is a general interface for **Bayesian exponential smoothing model**. The goal of Orbit development team is to create a tool that is easy to use, flexible, interitible, and high performing (fast computation). Under the hood, Orbit uses the probabilistic programming languages (PPL) including but not limited to Stan and Pyro for posterior approximation (i.e, MCMC sampling, SVI). Below is a quadrant chart to position a few time series related packages in our assessment in terms of flexibility and completeness. Orbit is the only tool that allows for easy model specification and analysis while not limiting itself to a small subset of models. For example Prophet has a complete end to end solution but only has one model type and Pyro has total specification model flexibility but does not give an end to end solution. Thus Orbit bridges the gap between business problems and statistical solutions.<ul><li>[:octocat: Orbit: A Python Package for Bayesian Forecasting](https://github.com/uber/orbit)</li><li>[Orbit‚Äôs Documentation](https://uber.github.io/orbit/)</li><li>[Quick Start](https://uber.github.io/orbit/tutorials/quick_start.html)</li><li>[Orbit: Probabilistic Forecast with Exponential Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08492) Paper</li></ul>|
|[Greykite](https://linkedin.github.io/greykite/) by LinkedIn|<ul><p>The Greykite library provides flexible, intuitive and fast forecasts through its flagship algorithm, Silverkite.</p><p>Silverkite algorithm works well on most time series, and is especially adept for those with changepoints in trend or seasonality, event/holiday effects, and temporal dependencies. Its forecasts are interpretable and therefore useful for trusted decision-making and insights.</p><p>The Greykite library provides a framework that makes it easy to develop a good forecast model, with exploratory data analysis, outlier/anomaly preprocessing, feature extraction and engineering, grid search, evaluation, benchmarking, and plotting. Other open source algorithms can be supported through Greykite‚Äôs interface to take advantage of this framework.</p><li>[:octocat: Greykite](https://github.com/linkedin/greykite)</li><li>[Getting Started](https://linkedin.github.io/greykite/get_started)</li><li>[A flexible forecasting model for production systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01098) Paper</li><li>[Greykite: A flexible, intuitive, and fast forecasting library](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2021/greykite--a-flexible--intuitive--and-fast-forecasting-library)</li></ul>|
